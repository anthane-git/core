# ðŸªœ Base

It's so great to see you here! Core Base Is The Foundation Of The Core Design System

## Figma UI kit

To access our library, duplicate the files you can find at our community profile.

These appear in your Drafts.
Now you can work with them to create your own designs.

If you have a team plan, you can also use the files as a library.
