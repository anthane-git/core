# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

It's so great to see you here! Core Base Is The Foundation Of The Core Design System

## Figma UI kit

To access our library, duplicate the files you can find at our community profile.

These appear in your Drafts.
Now you can work with them to create your own designs.

If you have a team plan, you can also use the files as a library.
See the [Figma docs for how to publish the files to a library](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025508373).

> Currently, Figma doesn't provide notifications when our public files are updated.
> To make sure you stay up to date, check the _Last updated_ date on the files at our community profile
> and [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Core).

## Font

By default, our libraries use Steinbeck, which isn't an open font.

If you don't have a license, you can replace it with Roboto, a free font from Google.
You can [download Roboto from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
