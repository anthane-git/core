# Button

Button component is used to trigger an action or event,
such as submitting a form, opening a Dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.

<a
	href={
		'https://anthane-git.github.io/core-elements/?path=/story/controls-button--contained'
	}
	target={'_blank'}>
	Storybook Link
</a>

<br />

## Import

To implement Button component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@anthane/core-elements';
```

## Usage

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```tsx
<Button type="contained" variant="primary">
	Contained Button
</Button>
```

<Embed src={'?path=/story/controls-button--contained&full=1&'} />

## Types

Use the type prop to change the appearance of the button.
You can set the value to contained, contained, outlined, or text.

<div className={'row'}>
    <Embed
    	src={'iframe.html?args=&id=controls-button--contained&viewMode=story'}
    />
    <Embed
    	src={
    		'iframe.html?args=type:outlined&id=controls-button--contained&viewMode=story'
    	}
    />
    <Embed
    	src={
    		'iframe.html?args=type:text&id=controls-button--contained&viewMode=story'
    	}
    />

</div>

## Accessibility

A button is mainly used for indicating an action, submitting a data, opening a modal etc.

- Use `disabled` prop to indicate users that button is inactive and they can't interact with it.
