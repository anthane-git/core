# Text

Text component is a component that is used to render text in the context of an input field.

<a
	href={
		'https://anthane-git.github.io/core-elements/?path=/story/form-label--primary'
	}
	target={'_blank'}>
	Storybook Link
</a>

<br />

## Import

To implement the component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```tsx
import { Form } from '@anthane/core-elements';
```

## Usage

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```tsx
<Form.Text>Form Text</Form.Text>
```

<Embed src={'?path=/story/form-label--primary&full=1'} />

## Accessibility

This component is based on the native label element, it will automatically apply the correct labelling when wrapping controls or using the htmlFor attribute.
For your own custom controls to work correctly, ensure they use native elements such as button or input as a base.
