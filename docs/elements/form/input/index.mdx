	}
	target={'_blank'}>
	Storybook Link
</a>

## Import

To implement Button component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```tsx
import { Form } from '@anthane/core-elements';
```

## Usage

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```tsx
<Form.Input type="text" />
```

<Embed src={'?path=/story/form-input--text&full=1'} />

## Accessibility

A button is mainly used for indicating an action, submitting a data, opening a modal etc.

- Use `disabled` prop to indicate users that button is inactive and they can't interact with it.
