# Body

Input component is a component that is used to get user input in a text field.

<a
	href={
		'https://anthane-git.github.io/core-elements/?path=/docs/form-input--text'
	}
	target={'_blank'}>
	Storybook Link
</a>

<br />

## Import

To implement Body component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```tsx
import { Body } from '@anthane/core-elements';
```

## Usage

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```tsx
<Body type="contained" variant="primary">
	Contained Body
</Body>
```

<Embed src={'?path=/story/controls-button--contained&full=1&'} />

## Accessibility

A button is mainly used for indicating an action, submitting a data, opening a modal etc.

- Use `disabled` prop to indicate users that button is inactive and they can't interact with it.
