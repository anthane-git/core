# ðŸ“¦ Get Started

To use Anthane Core in your project, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. Install core tokens

```bash
npm i @anthane/core-tokens@1.2.3
```

2. Install core elements

```bash
@anthane/core-elements@1.2.4
```

3. Install core fonts

```bash
npm install @anthane/core-fonts@1.0.1

> After installing Anthane Core, you need to set up the core fonts at the root of your application. This can be either in your index.jsx, index.tsx or App.jsx depending on the framework you use.
